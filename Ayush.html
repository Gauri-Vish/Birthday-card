            <p>I know this isn't much but this is what I and Chat GPT cam up with lol😁
. I love you Ayush❤️ and nothing has made me more happier than you being in my life. Jindagi 100 chize same ho sakti hai pr tere sath wali shayad hi wapis milegi. Thank you to your mom teko paida karne kliye and thank you to you for winning the race🥸
🤩! I know teko bahut sunati hu aur 'nag' karti hu which is not gonna stop obviousy but know that its either just fun to irritate you or for your betterment coz sorry to mai bolega nhi 😁
 Kidding! Love you a lots and maje karna, monica jaise stripper bhejna tha but you being chandler kuch nhi karta. Koi bat nhi silver jubilee pe dekhte... muah🥰
😘</p>
<p>Wishing you a year filled with great adventures and even better code! 🚀</p>
<p>From GPT - May your days be as bug-free as your code and your nights as restful as a successful deployment.</p>
        <p>Every moment with you is like a beautifully written code - efficient, straightforward, and solving the complexities of life. 🧩</p>
        <p>Here's to more debugging, less sugar, and countless memories together. Love you tons! ❤️</p>
