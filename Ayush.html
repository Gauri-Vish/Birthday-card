. I love you Ayush❤️ and nothing has made me more happier than you being in my life. Jindagi 100 chize same ho sakti hai pr tere sath wali shayad hi wapis milegi. Thank you to your mom teko paida karne kliye and thank you to you for winning the race🥸

 Kidding! Love you a lots and maje karna, monica jaise stripper bhejna tha but you being chandler kuch nhi karta. Koi bat nhi silver jubilee pe dekhte... muah🥰
